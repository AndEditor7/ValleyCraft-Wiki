## Redstone Lanterns, Hanging Lanterns & Braziers

Redstone lanterns give off a signal just like regular Redstone Torches, but they can be hung up and also used underwater.

Hanging Varients are made by using two Iron Nuggets to form a bar:

Braziers provide a nice, (mostly) safe atmosphere while lighting up rooms effectively. They can be made with Coal, Charcoal, and Soul Sand. Soul Sand will give a Soul Brazier varient which can be used to scare away Piglins!
