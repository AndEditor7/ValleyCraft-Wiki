Do not port to Forge, future versions of Fabric or use the existing assets for your own mods. You are welcome to use this in Modpacks, but please give credit <3 Thanks!

Note: if I am inactive for two major game updates (i.e. 1.18 and 1.19, not 1.17.1 and 1.17.2) then you can port this mod to future versions of Fabric. But not Forge because #### Forge.
