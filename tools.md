Knives can be made with any vanilla tool material (i.e. Iron, Stone, et cetera) as well as upgraded to Netherite with a [Smithing Table](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Smithing_Table) much like any other Diamond gear. Knives cut through Grass and Tall Grass dropping **Plant Fiber**.

Plant Fiber is used to make **Rope**, the a vital item in many recipes, such as **Rope Bridges**, **Nets**, and **Braziers**.
